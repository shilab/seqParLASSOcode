0. How to start
    There are 385 tasks and for each task we need to set a parameter named
    ``ROUND" (ranged in 1 ~ 10) for it. These two parameters are specified
    in step-1.

1. Prepare the folder of current task:
    In this step, a folder called ``task_indep" will be created with the
    following instructions:

        unzip 5002_indep.zip
        cd 5002_indep
        make TASKID=12 ROUND=8

    In ``task_indep" is a independent folder for the whole computation task
    and doesn't need any external information.

2. Start the computation task:
        
        cd task_indep/task_xxx_xxx
        make

    These two commands will start the whole computation task for the current
    task.

3. The whole procedure would be:

        unzip 5002_indep.zip
        cd 5002_indep

        for taskid in `seq 1 385`
        do
            for roundi in `seq 1 10`
            do
                make TASKID=12 ROUND=8

                # copy the ./task_indep folder and submit it to the proper node
                ./submit_to_proper_node

                # start the computation for the node
                make -C task_indep/task_xxx_xxx
            done
        done
    
    I don't know the exact procedure of submitting and starting the task, but
    folder task_indep generated by step-1 has already contained all
    information we need for this task/round.

    Then just need to find a node to start this computation, by execute make
    command in the task_indep/task_xxx_xxx.
